BLUECP README UPDATED: AUG 2012
=====================================
BlueCP is a project which is still
in development and as such the code
in here is probably crap.

=====================================
SETUP DIRECTIONS UNTIL INSTALL EXISTS
=====================================
1. Generate an RSA key for your server
by issuing the following commands from
the root user... If any of thesecommands
ask you questions just hit enter:
	cd $HOME
	ssh-keygen -t rsa
	cat id_rsa.pub >> .ssh/authorized_keys
	cp id_rsa /usr/share/nginx/

2. Create a database and a user via mysql,
use the data.sql file to populate the database.
Update the table settings, set the default_ip
to your servers IP. 
	
3. Make a file in /usr/share/nginx and
call it config.json . Use the config.example
file as a template. You should only need to
update the database settings and enter a
random salt. DO NOT USE THE DEFAULT!

5. Profit!
