NEON README UPDATED: MARCH 2013
=====================================
Neon is a project which is still
in development. The intent of neon
is to be a fully usable control panel
for servers with multiple user support
and to offer easy to use tools for
building and maintaining websites.

==========================================
SETUP DIRECTIONS (FULL INSTALLER)
==========================================
As a precaution I would like to take the time
to make sure that if you have a copy of nginx,
mysql, php or apache installed on your server
please DO NOT install NEON. NEON will overwrite
any configuration you have, delete files and
folders you may need and may without jusification
destroy anything and everything on your server.

As such please only install neon on a blank server/vps with Debian 6.

Copy & paste this command into SSH:

cd ~ && wget --no-check-certificate https://raw.github.com/BlueVM/Neon/develop/neon-installer.sh && bash neon-installer.sh

=========================================
MAIL DIRECTIONS (MANUAL SETUP FOR NOW)
==========================================
Updates to installer to support email. Now installs: dovecot, postfix and roundcube.

Dovecot / Postfix in normal locations (/etc/program)
Roundcube installed to /var/neon/roundcube
Nginx config added for roundcube.
Roundcube remotely accessible from https://yourip:2027
Added database `mailserver`.
Added database `roundcube`.

Neon does not have the ability to create mail accounts at this time. This must be done manually:
1. Go into the database `mailserver` and the table `virtual_domains`. Insert a row for your domain, remember the `id` collumn for step 2.
2. Go into the database `mailserver` and the table `virtual_users`. Insert a row with the domain_id, a password generated via the command "doveadm pw -s CRYPT" and an email "example@domain.com".
You should now be able to login to roundcube, send and recieve email (assuming your domain has an MX record pointed at the server).

==========================================
KNOWN BUGS
==========================================
- Upon deleting a user from a database on /mysql.php?view=databaseusers the system will loose styling (visually) for the drop downs. No known solution yet found, does not impact usability or application performance.

==========================================
